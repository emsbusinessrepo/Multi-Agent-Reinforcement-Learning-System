Designed and implemented a grid-world coordination task requiring multi-agent collaboration and communication to deliver an item to a secure target zone.
- Developed Type 1 and Type 2 AI agents using shared Tabular Q-learning to learn optimal collaboration strategies under partial observability.
- Implemented agent-to-agent information exchange (A2A) to unlock access to the target — simulating agentic knowledge sharing.
- Employed game theory analysis to evaluate emergent coordination and strategic behavior among agents.
- Balanced agent performance through resource trade-offs: “purchasing” sensors and coordination options vs. raw learning performance — mirroring real-world optimization under constraints.
- Tools: Python, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym-style environment, deep Q-learning, game theory.
